# Kachupa
**Delicious Dish for Typescript and JavaScript projects.**

In [Cape Verde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde) we have a saying:

"_Put a person to work in the field and serve them anything other than [Cachupa](https://www.crumbsnatched.com/cachupa-traditional-dish-of-cape-verde/) 
for breakfast, and you'll notice a decline in productivity and motivation. Therefore, give them Cachupa and spice it up on the side._"

Just as Cachupa is an essential part of Cape Verdean culture, this library brings functional elements to enhance your 
productivity and developer happiness. So, consume (use) it!

> **Cachupa**, Cape Verde’s national dish, is a flavorful stew consisting of hominy, beans, seasoned meats, and vegetables. 
> Each family has its unique version, leading to delightful variations. 
> One undeniable fact: there is no Cape Verdean who doesn't appreciate Cachupa — whether for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or any time, anywhere.
